    <!-- The brief is to create a 4-10 page website with subject matter of our choosing.
    Each page should contain a relevant doctype, be well commented, well formatted and free from JavaScript errors.
    The site should be based on Bootstrap and jQuery, making it fully responsive.
    It should have a consistant navigation system, with the major sections of the website always accessible.
    It should contain a selection of Bootstrap components. 
    It should contain a transition effect or some other animated jQuery effect.
    It should include some custom CSS, with user defined classes and IDs.
    It should communicate with at least one Bootstrap plugin using Data Attributes.
   	It should exercise best practice in page load order. 
    Code should be commented sufficiently and any re-used code referenced. -->

                        <p></p>
                        <p>Athlone Town Football Club is the oldest senior football in Ireland.</p>
                    
                        <p>Founded in 1887 by Orlando Robert Coote, the Club joined the then Free State League in 1922; the first club from outside Dublin to do so.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Club won the Free State (FAI) Cup in 1924, beating Cork side Fordsons 1-0 in the Final on St. Patrick's Day 1924. The side did not concede a single goal in the
                        competition, and beat Shelbourne and Bohemians on their way to the Final.</p>
                        
                        <p>In recognition of their achievements, five members of the Cup winning team were chosen to represent the fledgling state at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, thus becoming
                         Ireland's first international footballers, and Olympians. This period is chronicled by Tadhg Carey in his book "<a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#wwwk">When We Were Kings</a>".</p>
                         
                        <p>The Club dropped out of senior football in 1929, and didn't return to it again until 1969, when they re-joined the League alongside Finn Harps.</p>
                        
                        <p>There wasn't long to wait for more drama. After finishing runners-up to Bohemians in the 1974/75 season, Town qualified for the UEFA Cup.</p>
                        
                        <p>Drawn against little knock Norwegian side Valerenga, Athlone advanced to the next round 4-2 on aggregate.</p>
                        
                        <p>If their First Round opponents were little known, their Second Round opponents were world renowned AC Milan.</p>
                        
                        <p>Athlone welcomed the Italian giants to St. Mel's Park on a September afternoon in 1975, and sent shockwaves around the world when they emerged with a 0-0 draw.</p>
                        
                        <p>In fact, Athlone missed a penalty, when John Minnock's weakly-struck spot-kick were gratefully gathered by Italian international goalkeeper Enrico Albertosi.</p>
                        
                        <p>League titles followed in 1981 and 1983 under the guidance of local legend, Turlough O'Connor.</p>
                        
                        <p>In recent years the Club has fallen from grace, spending most of their time in the lower, First Division.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, there was some cheer in 2013, when controversial manager Roddy Collins guided the side to the First Division title, and promotion to the Premier Division.</p>
